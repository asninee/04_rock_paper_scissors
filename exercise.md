# Making a game

### Duration

You have around 2 hours to complete this task.

### Team

For this task, work on your own.

## Learning objectives

- **Use** pseudocode to design algorithms
- **Use** Javascript to write straightforward programs
- **Recognise** and debug simple Javascript structures
- **Run** Javascript programs from the command line
- **Import** and use functions from external libraries
- **Find** and use documentation to apply concepts to new tools

## Brief

Create a program that plays [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) with the user.

When the user completes a game - win or lose - they should be prompted to begin another one.

The program should only use console output; no graphics are needed.

### Extensions

- Different coloured output for a win, loss, or draw
- The game should keep track of the user's results, and display them when prompted
- Any additional features that you wish

### Guidance

- Start with pseudocode
- Build a **minimum viable product** (MVP): build the simplest possible form of the game, and then make it more complicated
- You will have to do some research to work out how to solve specific problems
